#### Step 1 - Find your game!

Pick a game you want to play endlessly and **understand at a deeper level!** Speedrunning is all about optimising every aspect of your gameplay.

Some games have a obvious end, some do not! Check speedrun.com for existing categories if you aren’t sure what goals exist for your favourite game.

Sometimes this goal is full completion (100%), reaching the end/goal (Any%), or doing so with no glitches or exploits (Glitchless).

#### Step 2 - Learn the strats!

Speedrunning is no good without the speed! Spend some time studying what you should be doing:

- See what existing runs are doing
- Check videos or explainers
- Many games have an active Discord community

Or simply **ask someone!** Most speedrunners are passionate about their game, and want to help anyone

#### Step 3 - Put it in action!

There’s no substitute for practice! **Build up** from small individual components to larger sections. 

Eventually you want to be completing full runs. But remember, at this stage you are practicing, **complete runs are more important than perfect runs.**

Use a utility like LiveSplit to time your 
sections and runs.

#### Step 4 - Record your run!

Whether it’s a phone camera pointed at your screen or a pro stream setup, **give us a video!** We aren’t expecting fireworks, but we do want an idea of what you can do.

There are many screen recording utilities, use whatever you are familiar with. If you don’t know where to start, OBS is very popular! 

Recording capabilities on consoles are variable (to put it nicely), and some computers cannot handle it as well as the game, so **don’t worry about the recording quality of this run - this is just for us organizers.**

#### Step 5 - Submit!

Submit a recording on our **Oengus!** Make sure you are in our Discord (link in bio) , and mark your availability over the dates.

For an event like ours, we would much prefer an **informative and interesting** run over a perfect silent run. 

We’d love you to give an idea of your commentary and knowledge in your demo run, but no worries if you can’t manage it.
