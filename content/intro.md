Started in 2016, Warwick's Awesome Speedruns and Demos (WASD) is a 2-day speedrunning event held annually at the University of Warwick. It is the largest student-run speedrunning event in the UK. We've showcased a wide variety of games from nailbitingly difficult ones such as Getting Over It and Dark Souls III to living room favourites such as Mario Kart Wii and Splatoon 3. As well as these, we've run some less standard titles such as Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear To The Rescue, Geoguessr and Deathsmiles IIX Makai no Merry Christmas. We also dabble in the insane! These runs include Celeste on DK Bongos, Super *Monkey's* Ball and one person using 2 controllers to play Cuphead. WASD will be returning on {{ event_date_range }}.

The event raises money for SpecialEffect, a charity which develops and provides assistive technology to help people with disabilities to play games.
