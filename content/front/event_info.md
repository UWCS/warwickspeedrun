Warwick's Awesome Speedruns and Demos (WASD) is a 2-day speedrunning marathon run yearly at the University of Warwick, UK.

WASD is the *largest* student-run speedrunning event in the UK, and it's now in its ***tenth*** year! WASD is back for {{ event_year }}, kicking off on {{ event_start_date }} at: <a target="_blank" href="{{ campus_location_url }}">{{ campus_location }}, University of Warwick, UK</a>!

We'll have great fun speedrunning, spectating and commentating a whole host of games, as well as doing various silly donation incentives to spice things up more!

The event raises money for [SpecialEffect](https://specialeffect.org.uk), a charity which develops and provides assistive technology to help people with disabilities to play games.

To date, we have raised over {{ money_raised }}!
