Started in 2016, Warwick's Awesome Speedruns and Demos (WASD) is a 2-day speedrunning event held annually at the University of Warwick. It is the largest student-run speedrunning event in the UK.

We've showcased a wide variety of games, from nailbitingly difficult ones, like *Dark Souls III*, to living room favourites, such as *Mario Kart Wii* and *Splatoon 3*.

Moreover, we've run some less standard titles such as *Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear To The Rescue*, and *Deathsmiles IIX Makai no Merry Christmas*.

Some runs may even surprise you! Fan favourites include our *Celeste* on DK Bongos run, *Super Monkey Ball* and *Geoguessr*. 

WASD will be returning on {{ event_date_range }} - [submissions are now open](/signup)!

Donations to the event are in support of [SpecialEffect](https://specialeffect.org.uk/), a wonderful UK-based charity whose mission is to put fun and inclusion back into the lives of people with physical disabilities, by helping them to play video games. They achieve this by using and developing a range of accessibility hardware and software, from modified joypads to eye-gaze technology.

To date, WASD has raised over {{ money_raised }}!
