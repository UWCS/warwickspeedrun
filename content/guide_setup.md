We are setup in the SU Atrium, as we were pre-pandemic, and we expect a similar layout to then. This picture is fairly old, but fairly well illustrates our setup.

The Atrium has a stage area, which we will be set up on, with two projector screen either side as you can see. You (the runners) will be centre stage, with commentators and some tech on stage as well (the on-stage layout is likely to change). Besides or behind the audience area, we will have a practice area, with some of the same PCs as is on stage! This should ensure setup is quite smooth.

## The Computers

The computers will be borrowed from [Warwick Esports Centre](https://warwick.ac.uk/esports), and are top-end: 5900X processors and RTX 3080 graphics cards. Check the [bottom of this page](https://warwick.ac.uk/esports/play/) for the full stats of these beasts. We will also have the full set of peripherals, including a headset. We will also be able to provide some controllers, but if you want to bring any of your own equipment, feel free! Ideally let us know beforehand, so we know to expect the switch-over.

## Consoles

[Warwick Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/) have a variety of consoles they are able to provide. If you require any of these for your run, ensure to request them beforehand:

- XBox: 360 & One
- Nintendo: Switch, Wii U, (Wii & GameCube)
- PS4
- Valve Index

If you are bringing your own console (or laptop/PC), we’ll be using a HDMI capture card to record your device’s output. Please ensure you can get a HDMI output from your console (if it is an old one) otherwise we cannot stream it.

## Remote Runs

If the following paragraph is gibberish to you, but you are doing a remote run, we will be releasing a remote tech guide closer to the event.

We’ll be using our own RTMP server to receive your game stream, please make sure this is a clean feed, with *only* the game video and audio; and we’ll be using VDO.Ninja to capture your webcam and microphone (if you are ok with video of course). 

We will send you a personal link to both of these to connect to ~15 minutes before your scheduled time. We recommend OBS to capture the game (either from your screen or a capture card from a console) and stream to our RTMP server.
