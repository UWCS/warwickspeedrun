We are set up in the SU Atrium, which is a lovely space. This picture is fairly old but well illustrates our setup.

The Atrium has a stage area, which we will be set up on, with two projector screens to either side. You (the runners) will be centre stage alongside commentators and some tech as well. Beside or behind the audience, there's a practice area with some of the same computers you'll be using. This should help with a smooth transition between practice and the actual run.

## The Computers

The computers are loaned from [Warwick Esports Centre](https://warwick.ac.uk/esports) and are top-end; they have 5900X processors and RTX 3080 graphics cards. Check [this page](https://warwick.ac.uk/esports/play/) for the full stats of these beasts! We also have the full set of peripherals, including a headset. We will be able to provide some controllers but feel free to bring any of your own equipment. If you do bring your own equipment, please let us know beforehand so we know what to expect with the switch-over.

## Consoles

[Warwick Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/) have a variety of consoles they are able to provide:

- XBox: 360 & One
- Nintendo: Switch, Wii U, (Wii) and (GameCube)
- PS4
- Valve Index

If you require any of these for your run, ensure to request them beforehand. Ideally, the Wii and GameCube would not be used, as capturing them is more complex.

If you are bringing your own console, laptop, or PC: then we’ll be using an HDMI capture card to record your device’s output. Please ensure you can get a HDMI output from your console (if it’s an old one), otherwise we cannot stream it.

## Remote Runs

If the following paragraph is gibberish to you, don’t worry! We will be providing a remote tech guide closer to the event.

We’ll be using our own RTMP server to receive your game stream. Please make sure this is a clean feed, with *only* the game video and audio. We’ll be using [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) to capture your webcam and microphone. We will send you a personal link to both of these to connect to ~15 minutes before your scheduled time. We recommend OBS to capture the game, either from your screen or a capture card from a console, and stream to our RTMP server.
