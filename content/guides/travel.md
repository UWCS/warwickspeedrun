## Location

Warning: the University of Warwick is on the outskirts of **Coventry, not the town of Warwick!**

<div class="whats-on-wrapper">

<div class="content">

### Rail and Bus

[Coventry Railway Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZVKQ3m2a81Uc7mq38) is well-connected to both Birmingham and London. 

There are frequent buses from [just outside Coventry Railway Station](https://goo.gl/maps/YAqPpQXVXqzpKPz76) to campus, taking either the 12X or 11 -- these also connect to the city centre.

[Canley Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7eR142uVegZR7f6x8) is the closest to the university geographically, but is a half-hour walk and not well served by buses.

### Arriving by Car

Warwick University is on the south-western edge of **Coventry** (Postcode: CV4 7AL). There is lots of parking available on campus, although not all of it is publicly accessible. See [this website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/carparks/) for up-to-date information. The parking rules on campus can be a little awkward, so please be careful.

### Getting Around Campus

Campus is walkable and fully wheelchair accessible. The SU Atrium (where weâ€™ll be) is on central campus and two minutes from the Bus Interchange. When navigating around campus, the [Interactive Campus Map](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8897421e6f5928c0d2e2) can be useful.

## Staying Nearby

<div class="whats-on-wrapper">
<div class="content">

If you're coming from further afield and want to stay overnight, there are a wide range of hotels to choose from - while we are not affiliated with any, here are a selection:

If you'd like to stay in central Coventry, then [Premier Inn Earlsdon Park](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-city-centre-earlsdon-park.html) and [Ibis Coventry Centre](https://all.accor.com/hotel/2793/index.en.shtml) are a close walk to the train station and bus routes.

If you'd like to be geographically closer, there is accomodation directly [on-campus](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/bed-and-breakfast/) at a premium. [Premier Inn Coventry South](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-south-a45.html) and [Village Hotel Coventry](https://www.village-hotels.co.uk/coventry) are also closer and connected by bus, with less amenities directly around. Finally, [Premier Inn Balsall Common](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/balsall-common/balsall-common-near-nec.html) is further out, but good value-for-money if you're driving.

## Eating Around Campus

<div class="whats-on-wrapper">
<div class="content">

The university campus hosts a range of places to eat and drink, owned by either the [SU](https://www.warwicksu.com/venues-events/eating-drinking/) or [University](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/retail/openingtimes/). There are also three pub-restaurants nearby: The Dirty Duck, Varsity, and The Phantom Coach. The [Cannon Park](https://www.cannonparkshopping.co.uk/) shopping center is directly adjacent to campus, with a big Tesco, Aldi, and some fast food places like Greggs and Subway.

Coventry Centre and Royal Leamington Spa have a more diverse selection, but require buses to reach.
