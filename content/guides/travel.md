## Location

**Please note: Warwick University is in Coventry, not the town of Warwick!**

<div class="whats-on-wrapper">

<div class="content">

### Arriving by Rail

Coventry Railway Station is well-connected to Birmingham and London. There are frequent trains from Birmingham New Street that take ~20 minutes. In addition, it may be more convenient to travel to Canley Rail Station which is also in walking distance of the University.

### Buses 
Coventry Railway Station has frequent buses to campus through the express 12X or the slower 11 (both operated by National Express). These can be caught from the [Rail Station Bridge stop](https://goo.gl/maps/YAqPpQXVXqzpKPz76), just outside the station (try to leave through the new bit). Alternatively, the 11 also stops at [Station Interchange](https://goo.gl/maps/Lu3GGVELEek24b7f8), through the underpass tunnel.

### Arriving by Car

Warwick University is on the south-western edge of **Coventry** (Postcode: CV4 7AL). There is lots of parking available on campus, although not all of it is publicly accessible. See [this map](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/carparks/where/where_can_i_park_-Jan_2022v2.pdf) and [this website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/carparks/) for up-to-date information. The car parking rules on campus can be a bit tricky, so please be careful.

### Getting Around Campus

Campus is walkable and fully wheelchair accessible. The SU Atrium (where we’ll be) is on central campus and two minutes from the Bus Interchange. When navigating around campus, the [Interactive Campus Map](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8897421e6f5928c0d2e2) can be useful.

## Staying Nearby

<div class="whats-on-wrapper">

<div class="content">

If you are coming from further afield and want to stay overnight in the local area, there is a wide range of hotels available in central Coventry, which are a short walk away from any bus-routes to the University Campus. There are many more than listed here, and we are not affliated with any.

[ibis Coventry Centre](https://all.accor.com/hotel/2793/index.en.shtml) Very close to the train station, so just as frequently served by the 12X and 11 buses.

[Premier Inn Earlsdon Park](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-city-centre-earlsdon-park.html) or [Premier Inn Belgrade Plaza](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-city-centre-belgrade-plaza.html) Slightly out the centre, fairly well-connected.

[Britannia Hotel Coventry](https://www.britanniahotels.com/hotels/the-britannia-hotel-coventry) On the far end of the city, though well served from Poole Meadow Bus Station. Likely the cheapest.

</div>

<div class="content">

We would generally then recommend hotels around the city centre, as they are much better connected to the university than some places geographically closer by. However, if you want to be closer (or drive), we have some options:

[Warwick Conferences: Scarman or Radcliffe](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/bed-and-breakfast/) On campus, but at a premium.

[Premier Inn Coventry South](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-south-a45.html) Despite being geographically closer to the university, the buses can be unreliable.

[Village Hotel Coventry](https://www.village-hotels.co.uk/coventry) Placed on the 11’s route, but doesn't have much around.

**Cannon Park** (~15mins walk): Greggs, Subway, Costa, Tesco, ALDI, Street food vans. Furthest away, but largest variety. There is also a nice pub called The Phantom Coach which is a little past Cannon Park.  
**Leamington & Coventry** Have plenty of other places to get food but may require a short bus ride to reach.
