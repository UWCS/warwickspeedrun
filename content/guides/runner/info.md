### Commentators

During your run, we will have some commentators to introduce your run, talk to you about your run, and read donations. We will provide some ourselves, but we'd love you to provide a commentator for your run, as it's always better to have someone who knows the game and knows you! No worries if you can't, we'll do our best to find/match our commentators to games. 

We can have in-person or online commentators, though in-person is a better experience for everyone. We have equipment for up to three commentators, although try to let us know as early as possible if you find someone.

### Donation Incentives

We've had some great donation incentives in the past, and there's nothing like messing with the runner to separate people from their cash! (it's for a good cause after all) 

Donation incentives can be almost anything:

- An upgrade to the run: "do x bonus level", "enable hard mode", or "collect a bonus collectible"
- A bid war over a basic choice: "which character to play with?", "clothing choice"
- Trigger an event: "will do x for every donation" (towards that incentive)
- Something silly (e.g. install a funny cosmetic mod or pet a dog in the game)
- Or something completely wild -- my favourite from last year was donations sending players in our Celeste Race fetching strawberries in game while eating a strawberry in real life!

Don't worry if you can't think of anything, we still have plenty of time, and we don't need one for every run.
