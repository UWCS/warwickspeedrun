### Arriving by Rail

Coventry Railway Station is well-connected to Birmingham and London. There are frequent trains from Birmingham New Street that take ~20 minutes.

### Buses 
Coventry Railway Station has frequent buses to campus through the express 12X or the slower 11 (both operated by National Express). These can be caught from the [Rail Station Bridge stop](https://goo.gl/maps/YAqPpQXVXqzpKPz76), just outside the station (try to leave through the new bit). Alternatively, the 11 also stops at [Station Interchange](https://goo.gl/maps/Lu3GGVELEek24b7f8), through the underpass tunnel. The Station has been recently refurbished, so don’t necessarily rely on Google Street View or older information.

### Arriving by Car

Warwick University is on the south-western edge of Coventry (Postcode: CV4 7AL). There is lots of parking available on campus, although not all of it is publicly accessible. See [this website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/carparks/) for up-to-date information. Car parks can get quite busy during the day, however will be quieter over the weekend. The car parking rules on campus can be a bit tricky, so be careful.

### Getting Around Campus

Campus is walkable and fully wheelchair accessible. The SU Atrium (where we’ll be) is in central campus. The Bus Interchange is a two minute walk, and close to various food outlets. When navigating around campus, we recommend the [Interactive Campus Map](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/) or your deafult maps app of choice.

<h1 class="title is-size-2">Staying Nearby</h1>
<div class="whats-on-wrapper" markdown="1">

<div class="content" markdown="1">

If you are coming from further afield and want to stay overnight in the local area, there is a wide range of hotels available in central Coventry, which are a short walk away from any bus-routes to the University Campus. There are many more than listed here, and we are not affliated with any.

**[Warwick Conferences: Scarman or Radcliffe](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/bed-and-breakfast/)** Situated on campus so very convenient, but quite pricey.

**[Premier Inn Coventry South](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-south-a45.html)** Despite being geographically closer to the university, it is poorly served by buses.

**[Village Hotel Coventry](https://www.village-hotels.co.uk/coventry)** Placed on the 11’s route, but isn’t close to anything really.

</div>

<div class="content" markdown="1">

We would generally then recommend hotels around the city centre, as they are much better connected to the university than some places geographically closer by.

**[ibis Coventry Centre](https://all.accor.com/hotel/2793/index.en.shtml)** Very close to the train station, so just as frequently served by the 12X and 11 buses.

**[Premier Inn Earlsdon Park](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-city-centre-earlsdon-park.html)** or **[Premier Inn Belgrade Plaza](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-city-centre-belgrade-plaza.html)** Slightly out the centre, fairly well-connected.

**[Britannia Hotel Coventry](https://www.britanniahotels.com/hotels/the-britannia-hotel-coventry)** Slightly out the wrong side of the city, but there are lots of buses from Poole Meadow Bus Station.

<div class="whats-on-wrapper" markdown="1">

<div class="content" markdown="1">

**[SU](https://www.warwicksu.com/venues-events/eating-drinking/)** Nothing exciting but cheap. There is the pub (The Dirty Duck) and cafe (Curiositea). Also run by the SU is Rootes Grocery Store it stocks Co-Op items (expensive).

**[University](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/retail/eat-drink/)** Slightly more expensive (but still cheap) and nicer. Are a bit further away. Their opening times can be found at [https://warwick.ac.uk/services/retail/openingtimes/](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/retail/openingtimes/).

</div>

<div class="content" markdown="1">

**[Cannon Park](https://www.cannonparkshopping.co.uk/stores/)** Cheapest but furthest away (~15 minute walk). Has Tesco, Costa, Subway and more. There are also a couple of streetfood stalls nearby. ALDI is a further 2 minutes away.

**Leamington & Coventry** Have a whole bunch of nice food but require a bus ride to get to.
