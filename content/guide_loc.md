### Arriving by Rail

Coventry Railway Station is well-connected to Birmingham, and has regular connections from London. There are very frequent trains from Birmingham New Street that take ~20 minutes. 

### Buses 
Coventry Railway Station has very frequent buses to campus through the express 12X bus or the slower 11 bus (both operated by National Express). These can be caught from the [Rail Station Bridge stop](https://goo.gl/maps/YAqPpQXVXqzpKPz76), just outside the station (try to leave through the new bit). The 11 can also be caught from the [Station Interchange](https://goo.gl/maps/Lu3GGVELEek24b7f8), through the underpass tunnel. The Station has recently been refurbished, so don’t necessarily rely on Google Street View or older information.

### Arriving by Car

Warwick University is on the south-western edge of Coventry (Post Code: CV4 7AL). There is a lot of parking available on campus, although not all of it is visitor accessible. Check [this map](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/carparks/where/where_can_i_park_-Jan_2022v2.pdf) and [this webpage](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/carparks/general_parking) for more information. These car parks can get quite busy during the day, but less so on the weekend. The car parking rules on campus can be a bit tricky, so be careful.

### Getting Around Campus

The campus is quite compact and well signposted, so walking through shouldn’t be too hard. The SU Atrium (where we’ll be) is a particularly quick walk from the Bus Interchange and contains multiple places to eat, with a fair few in the surrounding buildings as well. When navigating around campus, we recommend the [Interactive Campus Map](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=2080).

<h1 class="title is-size-2">Staying Nearby</h1>

If you are coming from further afield and want to stay overnight in the local area, there is a wide range of hotels available in central Coventry, which are a short walk away from any bus-routes to the University Campus. There are many more than listed here, and we are not affliated with any.

**[Warwick Conferences: Scarman or Radcliffe](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/bed-and-breakfast/)** Situated on campus so very convenient, but quite pricey.

**[Premier Inn Coventry South](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-south-a45.html)** Despite being geographically closer to the university, it is poorly served by buses.

**[Village Hotel Coventry](https://www.village-hotels.co.uk/coventry)** Placed on the 11’s route, but isn’t close to anything really.

</div>

<div class="content" markdown="1">

We would generally then recommend hotels around the city centre, as they are much better connected to the university than some places geographically closer by.

**[ibis Coventry Centre](https://all.accor.com/hotel/2793/index.en.shtml)** Very close to the train station, so just as frequently served by the 12X and 11 buses.

**[Premier Inn Earlsdon Park](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-city-centre-earlsdon-park.html)** or **[Premier Inn Belgrade Plaza](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/coventry/coventry-city-centre-belgrade-plaza.html)** Slightly out the centre, fairly well-connected.

**[Britannia Hotel Coventry](https://www.britanniahotels.com/hotels/the-britannia-hotel-coventry)** Slightly out the wrong side of the city, but there are lots of buses from Poole Meadow Bus Station.

## Eating around Campus

**In & around the SU**: Curiositea (cafe), Dirty Duck (pub), Pret A Manger, Bar Fusion

**On Campus**: Benugo (Arts Centre, fancy), most of the rest are closed on the weekend

**Cannon Park**: Subway, Greggs, Costa Coffee, Jacket Potatoes Van

**Other Near Campus**: Phantom Coach (pub), Varsity (pub)

You have to go quite a bit further to get to much else, but Coventry Centre or Leamington has plenty of options (both an easy bus away).

## Shopping around Campus

[**Rootes Grocery Store**](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/retail/shops/rootes-grocery-store/) Stocks Co-op goods. It’s very close by, but relatively expensive. 

**[Cannon Park Shopping Centre](https://www.cannonparkshopping.co.uk/stores/)** ~15 mins from the SU, it has a Tesco, Greggs, Subway, and plenty more.

**ALDI** Only slightly past Cannon Park is the local ALDI
