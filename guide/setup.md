We will be in Warwick Students' Union Atrium, which is a great venue for us.

We will be set up on the Atrium's stage, with two projector screens to either side. The central table with have tech on the far end, and two runner computers on the left and right. Most runs will alternate sides to give us more setup time, or both can be used for a race! Commentators will be in-front of the audience, and we'll have a practice area to the side (a couple of PCs & some monitors for consoles).

## The Computers

The computers are loaned from [Warwick Esports Centre](https://warwick.ac.uk/esports) and are top-end; they have 5900X processors and RTX 3080 graphics cards. Check [this page](https://warwick.ac.uk/esports/play/) for the full stats of these beasts! We provide peripherals & controllers, though you are welcome to bring your own. If you do bring your own equipment, please let us know beforehand so we know what to expect with the switch-over.

## Consoles

[Warwick Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/) have a variety of consoles they are able to provide:

- XBox One & 360
- Nintendo: Switch, Wii U, Wii, and GameCube
- PS4

If you require any of these for your run, ensure to mention this them beforehand.

If you are bringing your own console, laptop, or PC then we will be using an HDMI capture card to record your device’s output. For modern devices, this is straight forward, but older devices may need an adapter.

## Software

We can pre-install many games, however if there are any particular versions, DLCs, or settings you need beforehand, let us know. We always recommend you bring a USB with everything installed as a backup.

We will be running Livesplit integration with our stream, so if you have splits of your run, send them to us or bring them with you if you want them on stream.

## On The Day

Please come along at least half an hour before your scheduled slot and come talk to the tech crew. We will ensure your game works, switch anything you need and balance your audio *while the previous run is still going*.

## Remote Runs

If the following paragraph is gibberish to you, don’t worry! We will be providing a remote tech guide closer to the event.

We’ll be using our own RTMP server to receive your game stream. Please make sure this is a clean feed, with *only* the game video and audio. We’ll be using [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) to capture your webcam and microphone. We will send you a personal link to both of these to connect to ~15 minutes before your scheduled time. We recommend OBS to capture the game, either from your screen or a capture card from a console, and stream to our RTMP server.
