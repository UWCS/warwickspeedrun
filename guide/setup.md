## PCs and Consoles

The PCs are kindly loaned from the [Warwick Esports Centre](https://warwick.ac.uk/esports), and should have more than powerful enough [specifications](https://warwick.ac.uk/esports/play/) for your runs. We can provide a controller, or you can bring your own gear if you prefer - just let us know.

We can pre-install many games, however if you have requirements for specific versions, DLCs, or settings, let us know. We'd always recommend you bring a USB with everything installed as a backup, just in case.

The [Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/) can provide the following consoles - again, let us know if you need one for your run:

- Xbox: Xbox One X and Xbox 360
- Nintendo: Switch, Wii U, Wii, and GameCube
- Playstation: PS4

If you're bringing your own device, please note that we'll be using a HDMI capture card to record your device’s output. Older devices may need an adapter.

## On the Day

Please arrive **at least half an hour before** your scheduled slot, and come talk to the tech crew so we can set things up beforehand. The SU Atrium should look something like this:

We will be set up on a stage with three computers - two for runners on either side, and one at the back for tech. Most runs will alternate sides to help with setup times, or both can be used at once for a race! Commentators will be in front of the audience, and we'll have a practice area to the side (a couple of PCs & some monitors for consoles).

## Remote Runs

If the following paragraph is gibberish to you, don’t worry! We will be providing a remote tech guide closer to the event.

We’ll be using our own RTMP server to receive your game stream. Please make sure this is a clean feed, with *only* the game video and audio. We’ll be using [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) to capture your webcam and microphone. We will send you a personal link to both of these to connect to ~15 minutes before your scheduled time. We recommend OBS to capture the game, either from your screen or a capture card from a console, and stream to our RTMP server.
