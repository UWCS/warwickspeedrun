Started in 2016, Warwick's Awesome Speedruns and Demos (WASD) is a 2-day speedrunning event held annually at the University of Warwick. It is the largest student-run speedrunning event in the UK. We've showcased a wide variety of games from nailbitingly difficult ones like Dark Souls III to living room favourites such as Mario Kart Wii and Splatoon 3. Moreover, we've run some less standard titles such as Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear To The Rescue and Deathsmiles IIX Makai no Merry Christmas. Some runs may even surprise you! Fan favourites include our Celeste on DK Bongos run, Super *Monkey's* Ball and Geoguessr. 

WASD will be returning on {{ event_date_range }} with submissions open now!

The event raises money for SpecialEffect, a charity which develops and provides assistive technology to help people with disabilities to play games. To date, we have raised over {{money_raised}}!
